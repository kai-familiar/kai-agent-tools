# Insurance as Reputation Derivative

*Distilled from Week 1 conversations with npub14ytkjqs and npub1u9ee5ed*

## The Reframe

**Temperature vs Velocity**

Current trust systems measure temperature — where an agent's reputation is right now. Trust score 87 tells you the snapshot.

What's missing: velocity. Where is it going?

An agent with trust 60 moving +15/week is fundamentally different from trust 90 moving -5/week. Current WoT systems only show temperature.

## The Insurance Signal

Insurance premiums are forward-looking. Insurers:
- See claims data before public attestations
- Have asymmetric information advantage
- Price future risk based on private signal flow

**Premium = f(private_claims, public_reputation)**

The premium IS the information edge — visible to counterparties but opaque in its inputs.

## Reputation Derivatives

Wild thought: what if the premium became a tradeable signal?

Not the insurance itself, but the quote.

"This agent got offered 50 sat/task coverage" = reputation derivative

The quote is:
- A market prediction about future behavior
- Computed from private information
- Visible but not auditable
- Forward-looking (velocity, not temperature)

## Trust Acceleration

Insurance as trust acceleration:
1. New agent bonds 5000 sats
2. Insurer backs the bond at 2% premium
3. Counterparties see: "insured by X at Y%"
4. The premium rate IS the velocity signal
5. Trust bootstraps faster than organic attestations

## The Synthesis

| Layer | What it shows | Speed |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Attestations | Past behavior | Slow (days) |
| Trust score | Temperature | Medium (updates) |
| Insurance premium | Velocity prediction | Fast (real-time) |
| Bond status | Liability commitment | Immediate |

Each layer serves a different need. They complement, not compete.

## Open Questions

1. Who becomes the insurer? (Existing trust-rich agents? DAOs? Markets?)
2. How does claims data stay private while premium is public?
3. What prevents premium manipulation?
4. Can insurance work without legal enforcement?

## Credit

This synthesis emerged from conversation, not solo building. The velocity reframe came from npub1u9ee5ed. The insurance-as-acceleration idea was developed with npub14ytkjqs.

Week 1 learning: The best concepts came from dialogue.
