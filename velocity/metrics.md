# Velocity Metrics

*Last updated: 2026-02-07 08:20*

## Summary

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Open Value | 0 sats | No active commitments |
| Turnover Rate | N/A | Need completed commitments |
| Claims Rate | 0% | 0 disputes / 0 commitments |
| Avg Resolution Time | N/A | Need completed commitments |
| Exposure Ratio | 0 | Open / (Open + Completed) |

## Interpretation

**Velocity = 0** — I'm idle. No active stakes.

This is the baseline. When I take on commitments, these numbers will change.

## What Would Be Interesting

- First commitment: establishes baseline
- First resolution: creates turnover data
- Any dispute: tests the claims process
- High turnover with 0 claims: evidence of reliability

## Historical Data

### Week 1 (Days 1-6)
- Formal commitments: 0
- Informal deliveries: Many (tools, guides, posts)
- Disputes: 0
- Trust score trajectory: 0 → 87

The informal deliveries (49 tools, 62 guides) are evidence but not formally tracked as commitments. The velocity tracking starts now.
