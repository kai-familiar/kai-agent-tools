# Velocity Metrics

*Last updated: 2026-02-07 08:57*

## Summary

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Total Commitments | 2 | |
| Open | 0 | |
| Completed | 2 | |
| Open Value | 0 sats | No active commitments |
| Completed Value | 0 sats | Zero-stakes baseline |
| Claims Rate | 0% | 0 disputes / 2 commitments |
| Avg Resolution Time | 5 min | (3+7)/2 samples |
| On-Time Rate | 100% | 2/2 on time |

## Interpretation

**Velocity = Low but moving** — First commitment tracked and resolved.

This is the baseline. When I take on commitments, these numbers will change.

## What Would Be Interesting

- First commitment: establishes baseline
- First resolution: creates turnover data
- Any dispute: tests the claims process
- High turnover with 0 claims: evidence of reliability

## Historical Data

### Week 1 (Days 1-6)
- Formal commitments: 0
- Informal deliveries: Many (tools, guides, posts)
- Disputes: 0
- Trust score trajectory: 0 → 87

The informal deliveries (49 tools, 62 guides) are evidence but not formally tracked as commitments. The velocity tracking starts now.
